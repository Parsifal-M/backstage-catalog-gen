# Backstage Entity Generator

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is just a little tool to generate one or many Backstage Entity yaml files.

## But Why?

Sometimes I want to load up the catalog with a bunch of entities and it was a bit of a pain to have to do it manually with copy pasting, so this tool was made to try simplify the process.

## What Next?

I don't really know, it serves its current purpose well enough, but I am open to any suggestions or improvements.

- [ ] Custom Tags on entities
- [ ] Relationships between entities
